      Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by
      Adobe for Windows and macOS. It was originally created in 1987 by Thomas
      and John Knoll. Since then, the software has become the most used tool for
      professional digital art, especially in raster graphics editing. Drawing
      is a visual art that uses an instrument to mark paper or another
      two-dimensional surface. The instrument might be pencils, crayons, pens
      with inks, brushes with paints, or combinations of these, and in more
      modern times, computer styluses with graphics tablets. A drawing
      instrument releases a small amount of material onto a surface, leaving a
      visible mark. The most common support for drawing is paper, although other
      materials, such as cardboard, vellum, wood, plastic, leather, canvas, and
      board, have been used. Temporary drawings may be made on a blackboard or
      whiteboard. Drawing has been a popular and fundamental means of public
      expression throughout human history. It is one of the simplest and most
      efficient means of communicating ideas.The wide availability of drawing
      instruments makes drawing one of the most common artistic activities. In
      addition to its more artistic forms, drawing is frequently used in
      commercial illustration, animation, architecture, engineering, and
      technical drawing. A quick, freehand drawing, usually not intended as a
      finished work, is sometimes called a sketch. An artist who practices or
      works in technical drawing may be called a drafter, draftsman, or
      draughtsman.
